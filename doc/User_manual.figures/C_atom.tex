There are systems which cannot be describe by a simple mean-field
state within DFT. Trying to describe them, nonetheless, with DFT runs
into strange problems already with the static iteration. Many atoms
show this problem. We discuss here as simple example the carbon atom.

Figure \ref{fig:C_atom_instab} shows the (non-)convergence pattern of
four crucial observables. The total energy in the lower left panel
gives the impression of perfect convergence in that it approaches
quickly a stable asymptotic value. However, the average variance of
s.p. energies (upper left) is stuck at a too large value. Even when
playing with iteration parameters, there is no way to reduce the final
variance significantly. What happens becomes apparent when looking at
the behavior of s.p. energies and occupation numbers in detail. This
is done in the two right panels whereby we concentrate on states which
have a chance to be occupied. We see that there are two states in the
$1p$ shell never stop to exchange occupations from one iteration to
the next. Recall that C has total spin 1 in its ground state. The $1s$
shell is occupied by two electron, spin-up and spin-down. The two
remaining electrons are both spin-up to form a spin 1 configuration as
observed in experiment. The two electrons have three states to fill in
the $1p$ shell. Whichever two states we decide to fill the emerging
Kohn-Sham field yields s.p. energies which prefer the other
configuration (if the states are occupied in energy order as should be
done). Such systems as the C atom require correlated states to obtain
a unique ground state. Unfortunately, there is no simple rule to tell
in advance when such an unstable situation will occur as soon as one
deals with molecules because then the electronic state depends
sensitively on the ionic configuration. The user has to be alert to
spot the problem if it happens.
