\subsection{Storage of wavefunctions, densities and potentials}

Naturally, wavefunctions and other fields in spatial 3D representation
are would be handled as three-dimensional arrays, e.g. {\tt
  chpcoul3D(1:kxbox,1:kybox,1:kzbox)} for the Coulomb potential. However, in
order to simplify loops, all 3D fields are addressed as linear
arrays, e.g., for the Coulomb field {\tt chpcoul(1:kxbox*kybox*kzbox)}
where {\tt kxbox, kybox, kzbox} are the number of grid points in
$x$, $y$, and $z$ direction. The parameters defining and handling the grid 
are:
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{lcl}
{\tt kxbox} &:& total number of grid points in $x$-direction
\\
{\tt kybox} &:& total number of grid points in $y$-direction
\\
{\tt kzbox} &:& total number of grid points in $z$-direction
\\
{\tt nx2}   &:& equivalent to {\tt kxbox}
\\
{\tt ny2}   &:& equivalent to {\tt kybox}
\\
{\tt nz2}   &:& equivalent to {\tt kzbox}
\\
{\tt nx} &:& ={\tt nx2/2}, number of grid points with $x>0$, see eq. (\ref{eq:gridpoints}) 
\\
{\tt ny} &:& ={\tt ny2/2}, number of grid points with $y>0$, see eq. (\ref{eq:gridpoints}) 
\\
{\tt nz} &:& ={\tt nz2/2}, number of grid points with $z>0$, see eq. (\ref{eq:gridpoints}) 
\\
{\tt kdfull2} &:& ={\tt kxbox*kybox*kzbox}, total number of grid points
\\
{\tt nxyz} &:& equivalent to {\tt kdfull2}
\\
{\tt ix} or {\tt i1} &:& running index for $x$ values
\\
{\tt iy} or {\tt i2} &:& running index for $y$ values
\\
{\tt iz} or {\tt i3} &:& running index for $z$ values
\\
{\tt ind} &:& ={\tt ix}+{\tt nx2}*({\tt iy}-1)+{\tt nx2}*{\tt ny2}*({\tt iz}-1),
               running index for linear storage

The basic arrays concern densities, potentials, and
s.p. wavefunctions.  Densities and potentials distinguish spin which
is denoted by $\uparrow=$ spin-up and $\downarrow=$ spin-down.
Each s.p. wavefunction is associated with one unique spin
carried in the array {\tt ispin(1:kstate)}.
The fields are arranged the following way:
%\begin{center}
%\begin{tabular}{lcl}
\begin{description}
\item{\tt rho(2*kdfull2)} = density,
linearly stored in two blocks of length {\tt kdfull2}:
\\
 {\tt rho(1:kdfull2)} = total density 
  $\rho(\mathbf{r})=\rho_\uparrow(\mathbf{r})+\rho_\downarrow(\mathbf{r})$
\\
 {\tt rho(kdfull2+1:2*kdfull2)} = difference
  $\rho(\mathbf{r})=\rho_\uparrow(\mathbf{r})-\rho_\downarrow(\mathbf{r})$

\item{\tt aloc(2*kdfull2)} local Kohn-Sham potential,
linearly stored in two blocks of length {\tt kdfull2}:
\\
 {\tt aloc(1:kdfull2)} = local KS potential for spin-up
  $=U_\uparrow(\mathbf{r})$
\\
 {\tt aloc(kdfull2+1:2*kdfull2)} = local KS potential for spin-down
  $=U_\downarrow(\mathbf{r})$

\item{\tt chpcoul(kdfull2)} = Coulomb potential, linearly stored

\item{\tt psi(kdfull2,kstate)} = set of complex s.p. wavefunctions 
\\ 1. index for spatial disribution, 2. index counts the states
\\ complex array {\tt psi} for dynamics, real array {\tt psir} for static case
\\ each s.p. state has unique spin given in the array {\tt ispsin(1:kstate)}
\end{description}
